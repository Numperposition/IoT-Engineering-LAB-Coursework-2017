# WSN-based Distributed RFID Tags Inventory System
## IoT Engineering LAB Coursework 2017

## Introduction
The full target for this project is a system that can collect RFID tags from multiple terminal using WSN technology. Basically, each POS scans for in-range tags and reports the data. Using WSN protocols, multiple devices could be connected to the network automatically without extra configuration, and each POS could report to central device even with only one another POS in range.

This project is built with maven, and should contain a GUI-based software demonstration for above concept.
